# BC COVID-19 Case Data

This repository holds data on the patients in British Columbia found to have  COVID-19.

The data comes principally from 
[press releases](http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus) issued by the
[BC Centre for Disease Control](http://www.bccdc.ca/).

There are two CSV files, 
[one for the individual cases](cases.csv)
(including the date of diagnosis), 
and 
[one for the number of cumulative cases by day](cumulativeCases.csv).

I suspect that as the case count grows, we will stop getting individualized information
about each of the cases.
